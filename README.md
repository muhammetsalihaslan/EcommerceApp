# EcommerceApp
Ecommerce app made with react node.js redux stripe jwt--MERN STACK

******1********************************

Firstly we add react router dom library in our project about client side 
  CODE:: yarn add react-router-dom 
and after that import 
   code:: import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom"; for cover our page and component 


///////to avoid going to login and register if we logged in ///////
  code: 
    create user:: const user = true; //after const of app.js 
    {user ? <Home /> : <Login />}  



       *************Filter color and size****************
    
firstly we have to get category name(woman coat and jaens) use useLocation for it 

useLocation::This hook returns the current location object. This can be useful if you'd like to perform some side effect whenever the current location changes.

//const cat = location.pathname.split("/")[2]; its a definition of cat split / and take 2. element to shows us cat

we use useState hook for the value of color and size part and saparated each otjer use name property for spesification and for the every change use an onChange event 

*********How do we value color and size ::

we use uselocation to show exactly where we are

  code:  const cat = location.pathname.split("/")[2];

to get value from color and size using useState for the first action;

whenever we changed color  and size to update the state we use onChange event 

how to recognize color and size is selected to prevent this we use name property in color and size html part 

and final part  to show what we select and update value 
const handleFilters = (e) => {
    const value = e.target.value;  //
    setFilters({
      ...filters,  // filter spread for all our value inside of same curly bracket
      [e.target.name]: value,  // value is which we created 
    });
  };



//SORT METHOD::

Firstly we use useState for take an value 

  const [sort, setSort] = useState("newest");

and in the sort html part we gonna set our state directly here;

onChange={(e) => setSort(e.target.value)}

//products component part maybe most important part::

firstly we get an cat's all product  which is define by useState 

secondly we get another useState for filtered product can categorization 

use UseEFFECT change product list  when every cat is changing and for fetching we use axios for product list with cat ,

axios make with get method for fething


useEffect(() => {
    const getProducts = async () => {
      try {
        const res = await axios.get(   // use get method 
          cat
            ? `http://localhost:5000/api/products?category=${cat}`   // category=${cat} we have to make for our cat define category in products.js/root/api 
            : "http://localhost:5000/api/products"      //**if there is a category use first otherwise use second 
        );
        setProducts(res.data); // we take the products/cat with setProduct
      } catch (err) {}
    };
    getProducts();  // we have to call our function  here otherwise function is not work
  }, [cat]);


  const [filteredProducts, setFilteredProducts] = useState([]); whenever we change our filter we have nev filteredProduct to do that we have create this useState

  cat && setFilteredProducts() // if there is a category set filtered product

  useEffect(() => {
    cat &&
      setFilteredProducts(
        products.filter((item) =>  
          Object.entries(filters).every(([key, value]) => //all enties every key and value should be checked 
            item[key].includes(value) // if item key includes value we are gonna filter it 
          )
        )
      );
  }, [products, cat, filters]);

==!! take each item we are gonna check whether our item include thus filters or not we are choose our filters and look inside each key and value (color, size :: key, yellow and m :: value) if any item includes thus filters we are gonna display them 

db and html kod lowercase or uppercase must be equal in this project 

//MAÄ°N SORT PART::

 useEffect(() => {
    if (sort === "newest") {
      setFilteredProducts((prev) =>
        [...prev].sort((a, b) => a.createdAt - b.createdAt)  // sort nevest to oldest 
      );
    } else if (sort === "asc") {
      setFilteredProducts((prev) =>
        [...prev].sort((a, b) => a.price - b.price) // sort cheap to expensive
      );
    } else {
      setFilteredProducts((prev) =>
        [...prev].sort((a, b) => b.price - a.price) // sort expensive to cheap 
      );
    }
  }, [sort]);


 {product.color?.map((c) => (
                <FilterColor color={c} key={c} onClick={() => setColor(c)} />
              ))}  // if there is color setcolor
